This project is a project deling with debts management. Basically, for now the application allows to:

- display a notification when your internet connexion is on/off,
- refresh the page,
- sort the data into 3 different activities:
    - all the data,
    - only money that you owe,
    - only money that people owe you,
- change the colors of the text in the settings (preferences are saved),
- see the portfolio of one of the student who have made the app,
